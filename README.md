My personal site. Its hosted on github pages, redirects to a domain registered with namecheap (Lev.io), uses Jekyll and Poole for formatting, plus normalize.css to reduce browser issues, plus a whole lot of custom CSS for those sweet animations. It works in safari, chrome, firefox, and probably internet explorer (not that I would know, I haven't looked at IE for 5 years). It's almost entirely mobile responsive - everything looks pretty except the navbar needs to have font that scales as a percentage and not be fixed.
